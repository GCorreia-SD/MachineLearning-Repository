# MachineLearning-Repository

This repository contains some projects developed with learning machines in the Special Topics in Computer Engineering course for statistical analysis. In this way, the contents of:

- KNN: K-Nearest Neighbors
- SVM: Support Vector Machine
- MLP: Multilayer Perceptron
- Decision Tree

Below you can see the graphs of the work carried out to obtain a machine learning model for analyzing Breast Cancer Cases, having obtained them respectively:

- Correlation Matrix Data
- Receiver Operating Characteristic
- Learning Curve
- Feature Importance
- Decision Tree
- Confusion Matrix
- Distribuition of Diagnoses
